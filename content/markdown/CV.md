## Employment
- **Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.** November 2020 - . Postdoctoral Fellow in the Applied Energy Materials Group. Working on short time scale simulations of metal ion batteries.
- **Mercury Technologies, Inc.** April 2020 - August 2020. Software Engineer. Added many features to the backend web server. Diagnosed and fixed a race condition which was causing hundreds of errors per minute to go unlogged.
- **University of California, Santa Barbara.** September 2019 - March 2020. Lecturer and Postdoctoral Fellow. Course coordinator for [Calculus 4](https://danielbarter.github.io/pdf/calc_4_slides.pdf).
- **Australian National University.** February 2018 - August 2019. Postdoctoral fellow. Worked on constructing new exactly solvable quantum field theories using tools from algebraic topology and low dimensional category theory.
- **University of Sydney.** August 2017 - January 2018. Postdoctoral researcher in Physics. Learned quantum field theory by interacting with researchers in condensed matter physics and quantum information theory.
- **University of Michigan.** September 2012 - May 2016. Graduate student instructor for calculus 1, 2 and 3. Taught classes with 20-30 students, three times a week. Held office hours. Helped students use Mathematica. Graded homework/exams.
- **University of Sydney.** March 2011 - June 2012. Tutor for calculus 1 and 2. Supervised problem sessions and graded homework/exams.

## Education
- PhD, Mathematics, University of Michigan. September 2012 - May 2017. Specialized in representation theory. Thesis: [Some Remarks about the Interaction between Quantum Algebra and Representation Stability.](https://danielbarter.github.io/pdf/thesis.pdf)
- B.Sc with First Class Honours and University Medal, Pure Mathematics, University of Sydney. March 2008 - December 2011.

## Software
- **C++** : Language of choice for programs which need to run fast. [RNMC](https://github.com/BlauGroup/RNMC) is the largest C++ program I have built. Good debugging skills. Some of my favourite libraries and tools: sqlite, gsl, openMPI, valgrind, gdb.
- **Python** : Scripting language of choice. [HiPRGen](https://github.com/BlauGroup/HiPRGen) is the largest python program I have built. My favourite way to use python is embedding it into a C++ program. Comfortable with core parts of the python scientific computing ecosystem: numpy, scipy, matplotlib, jax.
- **Haskell** : Langauge of choice for writing quick web servers, compilers and interpreters. Very comfortable with all the core abstractions and the C FFI.
- **Nix** : Package manager of choice. Nix Lets me say with certainty that my software will run on any computer connected to the internet. Check out my [NixOS configuration](https://github.com/danielbarter/nixos-config) which specifies all my Linux machines, from laptops to a desktop with an Nvidia GPU that is able to use the official Nvidia drivers for scientific computing and vfio passthrough for windows virtualization.
