<p> My name is <strong>Daniel Barter.</strong> I am a software engineer, working in scientific and high performance computing, mostly writing simulators. I have worked on simulators for </p>

<ul>
  <li> 2D gapped topological phases of matter
  <li> Lithium and Magnesium ion batteries
  <li> Linear optical quantum systems
</ul>

<p> More generally, I like solving science problems with big computers. Recently, I have been thinking a lot about how to build fault tolerant quantum computers with the surface code and lattice surgery. <script> document.write(getImage()); </script> </p>
