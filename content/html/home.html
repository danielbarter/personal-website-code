<p>
I am a mathematical physicist and software engineer, specializing in quantum computing.
I have spent a lot of time thinking about the connection between topological quantum field theory and quantum error correction.
I have built simulators for 2D gapped topological phases of matter, lithium and magnesium ion batteries and linear optical quantum systems.
Currently, I work on quantum error correction simulations and machine learning decoders.
