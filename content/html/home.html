<p>I am a mathematical physicist specializing in quantum computing.
I have spent a lot of time thinking about the connection between topological quantum field theory and fault tolerance.
Currently I work on fault tolerant logic for quantum LDPC codes.</p>

<p>I also have a substantial amount of software experience, and have built simulators for 2D gapped topological phases of matter, lithium and magnesium ion batteries and linear optical quantum systems.</p>
